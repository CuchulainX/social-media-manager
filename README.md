# Social Media Manager

**Website is discontinued. Will only be used to get the oauth token for now. Use scripts now instead in `./scripts`**

## Scripts

### `reddit.py`

Right now get the token from the website. Login via script will be coming in the future.

https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/

- multi image post (text as comment)
- single image post (no text, not possible because of reddit api)
- text post

### `pixiv.py`

Set the following env variables `PIXIV_USER` and `PIXIV_PASSWORD` and run the `login()` method in the script to get a token for the client.

Note: there is no official rest api documentation. But it's possible to find it using the pixiv mobile app and [mitmproxy](mitmproxy.org). It the easiest with an [android emulator](genymotion.com/) (< Android 7.0)

- post illustrations

### `twitter.py`

It uses OAuth 1.0 User Context because media upload is only supported with that. The following values have to be generated by you: Client Id, Client Secret, Access Token, Access Secret

https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps

- post tweets with images
